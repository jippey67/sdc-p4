# advanced lane line finding using various techniques

This repository contains the work I did for the advanced lane line project in the Udacity Self-Driving Car Nanodegree program.

The objective of the project is to find the lane lines on the road, lay them over the road image and show in the image the curvature of the road and the distance of the car from the center of the lane.
There are a couple of steps in the process:
1) correcting the distorture of the camera lens
2) transforming the image to obtain a bird's view
